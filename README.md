## Description
PocketPT is a prototype that will eventually substitute my physical presence as a Certified Personal Trainer with all of the same useful information that I would typically give my clients. Although I ultimately decided to change my career, I still wanted a way to help my clients achieve their fitness goals. I developed PocketPT to provide users with exercise and nutrition tips that are tailored to their goals and personal needs. To build the app, I used Express, Node.js, MongoDB, EJS, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
