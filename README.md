## Description
Pocket PT is a Personal Trainer in your pocket. 
With Pocket PT, you will be able to know the amount of calories 
you need to eat per day and the amount you need to spend to get to your goal.
Pocket PT also gives you suggestions of meals from three different diet styles,
and a whole workout routine, based on your training experience level.
